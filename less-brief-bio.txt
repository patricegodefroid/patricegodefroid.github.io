Patrice Godefroid is a Partner Researcher at Microsoft Research.  He
received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science
elective) and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University
of Liege, Belgium, in 1989 and 1994 respectively.  From 1994 to 2006,
he worked at AT&T/Lucent Bell Laboratories, where he was promoted to
"distinguished member of technical staff" in 2001. His research
interests include software model checking, program analysis, testing
and verification, security, and software engineering.

Patrice is probably best known for his early work on partial-order
reduction for model checking concurrent systems (his PhD thesis is
published as LNCS volume 1032 by Springer), for his work on VeriSoft,
the first software model checker for mainstream programming languages
such as C and C++, for his work on 3-valued model checking with
may/must abstractions for sound program verification and
falsification, and for his work on automatic test generation with
DART. More recently, he co-developed SAGE, the first whitebox fuzzer
for security testing, which was credited to have found roughly one
third of all the security vulnerabilities discovered by file fuzzing
during the development of Microsoft's Windows 7. In 2015, he
co-founded Project Springfield, the first commercial cloud fuzzing
service.
