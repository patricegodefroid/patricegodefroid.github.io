Model Checking of Software

Patrice Godefroid

Abstract:


Model Checking is an effective approach for checking the correctness
of concurrent reactive systems, such as circuit designs and
communication protocols. In this talk, I will start by presenting a
brief overview of the history of model checking. I will highlight
(what I think are) the main ideas that have influenced the theory and
practice of model checking during the last 20 years, both in academia
and industry.  Then, I will discuss the challenges faced in order to
broaden the applicability of model checking to software.
