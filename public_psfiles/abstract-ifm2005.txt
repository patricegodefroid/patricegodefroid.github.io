Software Model Checking: Searching for Computations in the Abstract or
the Concrete

Patrice Godefroid

Abstract:

  We review and discuss the current approaches to software model
  checking, including the complementary views of validation versus
  falsification and those of static versus dynamic analysis.  For
  falsification, also known as bug finding, we advocate the need for
  blended approaches that combine the strengths of both static and
  dynamic analysis. We outline possible directions of research in this
  area.
