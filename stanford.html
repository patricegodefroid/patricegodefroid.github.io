Design and Analysis of Communication Software
</H2>

<H2>
Stanford University, Fall Quarter 1999</H2>

Course CS399, given by Patrice Godefroid in collaboration with
Prof. David L. Dill.

<H2> Course Description</H2>

Communication software coordinates the information flow between
interconnected components in the multitude of networks that are
ubiquitous in our lifes: the internet, the telephone network, wireless
systems and pagers, banking networks, distributed databases, etc.
Communication software is notably hard to design and test because
communicating entities may interact in many unexpected ways.
<p>

This experimental course will provide an introduction to the design
and analysis of communication software from a fresh perspective. The
course will present a brief overview of existing practices and tools
used in industry for developing software and communication software in
particular. The course will focus on practical analysis techniques and
tools currently available to the software developer, and will discuss
their strengths and limitations.
<p>

Then we will present a new approach for automatically analyzing
communication software based on the use of systematic state-space
exploration techniques, also known as "model-checking". The ideas
developed in this part will be illustrated using VeriSoft, a new tool
for systematically testing concurrent reactive software
systems. VeriSoft integrates automatic test generation, execution and
evaluation in a single framework, and can quickly reveal behaviors
that are virtually impossible to detect using conventional testing
techniques.  This approach has been applied successfully for analyzing
(testing, debugging, reverse-engineering) several software products
developed in Lucent Technologies.
<p>

Finally, participants will experience first-hand the concepts
described previously in the course by designing, implementing and
testing a simple but realistic example of communication
software. Specifically, simple software "internet phones" will be
developed in C/C++ using a predefined platform (UNIX, TCP/IP, given
API for recording and playing sounds). The exercise will focus on the
development and testing of the call processing and signalling aspects
of the problem. This part will expose the participants to basic
notions of internet telephony.
